SNAP:DRGN is building a virtual authority list for ancient people through Linked Data collection of common information from many collaborating projects. The graph will provide: 1. identifiers for all persons who appear in one or more corpora and catalogues; 2. gold standard normalization data for parsing and proofing tools; 3. visualization of ancient persons, names, titles and relationships; 4. research tools for historians; 5. standards and software contributing to the Linked Ancient World Data community.
